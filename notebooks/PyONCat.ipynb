    "### About\n",
    "\n",
    "ONCat is a metadata catalog built to store information about neutron experiment data at HFIR / SNS.  The contents of the catalog can be viewed at https://oncat.ornl.gov.\n",
    "\n",
    "An API is available to allow programmatic access to the metadata stored in the catalog.  Documentation for the API is at https://oncat.ornl.gov/#/build.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook outlines the usage of \"PyONCat\", a Python module built to make communicating with the API a little easier.\n",

    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "The latest version of PyONCat should already be installed on https://jupyter.sns.gov as well as instrument / analysis machines, but if you are using a machine without it then it can be installed using `pip` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
