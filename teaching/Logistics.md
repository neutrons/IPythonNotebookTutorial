# Logistics
* Stickers: quite useful. Ask people to remove the green sticker before starting each exercise
* jupyter.sns.gov only works for SNS users. Other ORNL users have to be added temporarily
* jupyterhub server requirements (~70 simultaneous people):
  - Memory>32GB. better at 64GB 
* Copy-notebooks script seems working. The clickable links printed out in jupyter terminal were useful.
  - Needs to remember "Data" is a symlink. 
* h5py: needs HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING=FALSE
