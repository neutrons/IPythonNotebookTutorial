# Introduction to Python for Neutron Scattering Scientists

The Neutron Data Sciences Group will offer an Introductory Python Course for Staff.

February 26-28, 2019

The course is a series of example notebooks working with data from the neutron scattering instruments at HFIR and SNS.  We will use this "programming by example" philosophy to introduce the syntax of the Python language.
No prior experience with Python is required.  But any experience will be helpful.
We will run the examples from web based notebooks so you need to bring your laptop with a modern Browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari all work well)
We will hold this training at HFIR in 29A&B.  Please let us know your interest so we can be sure to hold you a spot.  A more detailed agenda will be developed closer to the training.  But here is an overview of the scope.

The first two days of the course will cover the following topics
Topics:

    - Using Jupyter Notebooks
    - Intro to Python
    - Loading and Plotting Ascii Data with Numpy and Matplotlib
    - Manipulating data using numpy
    - 1-D Levenberg Marquart Fitting using LMfit
    - Making 2-D color plots
    - Working with NeXus (hdf5) files
    - Searching for files with Python and Oncat
    - Using Mantid within Python
    - Simple widgets in Jupyter notebooks

We can cover some of the following topics on day 3.  Please let us know which of the following interest you.

    - Python from a traditional scripting interface
    - Working with XML files
    - Using CPU Parallelization
    - Scripting Paraview for visualizations
    - More advanced use of LMfit  
      - Multidimensional Fitting
      - Using other optimizers
      - sequential fitting
    - Sasview and SAS models from Python
    - Using neutronpy with TAS data
    - Manipulating large spreadsheets using pandas
